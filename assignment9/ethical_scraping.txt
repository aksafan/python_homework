3. Reflect on why websites use `robots.txt` and write 2â€“3 sentences explaining its purpose and how it promotes ethical scraping.
- It shows where web-crawlers, bots, parsers can access or not.
 For example, for defined `User-agent` it could be `Allowed` or `Disallowed` to access.
 It helps to point parsers into right direction and decrease chances to overwhelmed with requests for the site and to not be banned for parsers.
